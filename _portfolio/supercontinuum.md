An image of light leaking from a supercontinuum fibre. This setup was used for
initial tests of the optical fibre described in
[our hollow core fibre cell paper](/publication/2024-06-03-hcf-cell).

I entered this image to a research photography competition at the University of
Bath, it was not chosen for shortlisting, but this [photo of the back of an
office chair was](https://www.flickr.com/photos/uniofbath/52990710089/in/album-72177720309214832). I'm not at all bitter about this.

The supercontinuum fibre was fabricated by Harry Wood and Jim Stone at the
Universtity of Bath.
