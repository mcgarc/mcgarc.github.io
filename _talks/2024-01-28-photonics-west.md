I spoke at photonics west about all optical phase modulation, the ability to
enhance the process with an optical cavity, and fibre-integration.

This talk is [available
online](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/PC12911/PC129110E/Two-routes-towards-fibre-integrated-optical-switching-with-single-photons/10.1117/12.2692959.short), the [slides are here](/files/PhotonicsWest2024.pptx).
