## Abstract

Trapped-ion platforms have emerged as a powerful architecture for simulating quantum dynamics in chemical systems. They have enabled studies of time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy [1], geometric phase effects at conical intersections [2, 3], and classically intractable open-system dynamics [4]. However, existing implementations have been limited to harmonic oscillator models, failing to encapsulate the anharmonicity present in molecular potentials.

Here, we investigate implementing anharmonic dynamics in a trapped-ion system using all-optical quantum control. Specifically, we develop a flexible control scheme that leverages state-dependent forces and qubit rotations to engineer tunable anharmonic dynamics. As an example, we engineer a tunable double-well potential of the form ùëâ(ùë•) = Œ¥ùë•‡¨∂ + œµ cos(Œ∑ùë•). This allows access to rich, nonlinear motional dynamics, most notably quantum tunneling between the two wells. These results establish a new pathway for simulating chemically relevant potentials in a controllable quantum platform.
