I am an experimental quantum physicist, specialising in atomic, molecular and
optical physics. I am currently working in the Quantum Control Laboratory at
the University of Sydney.

I am currently working on quantum simulation of chemical dynamics using trapped
ion, as well as methods for bosonic quantum computing and sensing.

My research interests are broad, spanning molecular physics, quantum optics,
and fabrication of quantum devices.
