Marinade salmon (and maybe the vegetables) in:
* Soy sauce
* Honey
* Spring onions
* Chilli (optional)
* Ginger
* Capers (nice, but some may find too salty!)
* Black pepper

Rub the marinade into the salmon fillets to ensure a good coating.

After atleast 30mins, pan fry salmon in butter (without marinade bits)

Remove salmon from pan and rest. Fry veg with marinade. I like to use one green
and one other colour. Can use:
* Red peppers (recommended)
* Courgette
* Sampfire
* Asparagus (not sure about this with the pepper, another veg. might be nice)

Plate and serve. Maybe with rice.
