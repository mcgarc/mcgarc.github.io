This is Barney's paneer recipe. His original idea was to get fried paneer with
the mixed in taste of fresh cooked and uncooked coriander and spring onions. I
think it's evolved quite a bit


## Ingredients

* Paneer (about 200g per person)
* Baby tomatoes (sliced, about 200g per person)
* Fresh coriander (chopped, a couple of handfuls per person)
* Spring onions (sliced, 3-4 per person)
* Chilis (to taste)
* Garlic
* MSG (optional)

## Method

1. Fry the paneer in oil until brown on all sides. It's worth it to be patient with this.
1. Remove from pan and put to one side on paper towel to absorb excess oil
1. Gently fry the garlic and chili for one minute
1. Add the tomatoes and fry until they just start to break down. Season well
   (using MSG if you like)
1. Add back the paneer and cook until warmed back through. Don't mix it in too
   much or it will go really soft and lose all the crisp
1. Add half the spring onions and half the coriander, cook until sweated down a
   bit
1. Stir through the remaining spring onions and coriander then serve
   immediately.





* Dried lentils (100g per person should be fine, I like to use a mix of red and
  green, but anything that says it's suitable for dhal is fine)
* Fresh garlic (lots)
* Fresh ginger (lots)
* Fresh tomatoes
* Onions
* Gee (or butter)
* Garam masala

For the curry paste:
* Fresh corriander stalks (you could use seeds but this way you can save the leaves for a garnish)
* Cumin seeds
* Fennel seeds
* Fresh chilli
* Tomato paste
* Oil
* Salt and pepper

## Method

Thoroughly wash the lentils in a sieve. It is really important to get all the
starch and crud off.

Place the lentils in a large pot along with enough cold water to fully cover
them with about 1-2cm of clearance. Add salt and maybe a spoon of gee

Bring to the boil, then simmer with the lid off, stirring occasionally. You are
aiming for a really creamy consistency that is achieved as the lentils break
down and absorb the water. If the water boils off too quickly replenish with
boiling water. This can take quite a long time, but should be done in about
40mins at a rolling boil.

It is likely that scum will float to the top of the pot, this should be skimmed
off.

While the lentils are boiling, make the curry paste. Dry fry the seeds then
crush in a pestel and mortar. Chop and add the corriander stalks and chilli.
Squeeze in the tomato paste and season (best to crush whole black peppercorns).
Add a lug of oil. Set aside.

Fry onions in gee. Once golden add your curry paste, garlic, ginger and garam
masala for a couple of minutes. Toss in chopped fresh tomatoes and fry until
cooked. You're going to put this into the lentils so it should probably be
over-seasoned to the taste.

Once the lentils are creamy add the onion mix. Leave with the heat off and lid
on for 5mins then serve, or longer and reheat to serve as needed.

## Cheating

If you don't want to make your own curry paste, then you could use store-bought,
and bulk it out with whatever fresh spices you do have available.
